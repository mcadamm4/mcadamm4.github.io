          <h3>Personal Achievements:</h3>
          <p>
              My proudest achievement is my Leaving Certificate Construction Studies project, I am passionate about carpentry but unfortunately do not have the tools available to me to continue this hobby. 
              <br><br>
              I designed and built a dining room table, it was extremely intricate in that it was a Trestle style table (X-shaped legs and a cross beam), it had tempered glass sections on top to act as hot plates and the most impressive part was that the top would split in two and pull apart on a runner, a hidden mid-section would then flip into place to make it longer. My teacher said it was the most ambitious project he had ever seen a student undertake and had his doubts about if I was capable of completing it within the timeframe which I thankfully managed to dispel.
              <br><br>
              I received a B1 in the leaving certificate that year which broke my heart and was down to focusing too much on the practical and not devoting enough time to the portfolio part of the project. I ended up repeating the leaving cert to give myself more time to decide on a career path and up my points, the next year I built a cabinet to match the table and received an A1 this time. Both pieces now have a permanent home in my parent’s living room.
