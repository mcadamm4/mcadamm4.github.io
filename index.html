      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        I am originally from Co.Monaghan but live in Dublin. I am currently enrolled in my third year of a four year Computer Applications degree in Dublin City University.
        The course is extremely interesting and has really instilled in me a passion for the industry. I passed Second year with a 2.1 and managed to secure an internship with GBE Technologies as a Software Developement intern while also working my regular job with Lidl on weekends in my hometown Co. Monaghan.
        The real world experience has proven invaluable in motivating me to achieve better results in the coming year of college.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the summer I have been attending tech meetups frequently around Dublin to learn about new technologies and methodologies being used in the tech industry today such as ReactJS and Agile. I will be attending the Dublin Tech summit in February of 2017 and had been accepted to volunteer at the Web Summit in Lisbon this November but due to project deadlines for college I had to cancel.
      </p> 
      <p>
        I had been planning for a while to learn javascript and it turns out that some of our college modules focus on it this year so my plan is to become
        profiecent and to possibly include it in my 3rd year project. 
        Outside of study and work I enjoy playing football and cycle practicaly everywhere I go. When the opportunity presents itself I like to read and have recently began learning to use Android Studio and am also making my way slowly through Robert "Uncle Bob" Martins book "Clean Code" to improve my skills.
        Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.
