        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Mark McAdam, I am originally from County Monaghan but I live in Dublin for college. I am currently enrolled in a third level degree in Computer Applications in 
            Dublin City University and I enjoy all aspects of the course. I am almost finished 2nd year and am preparing for the summer exams. I really like working with computers and am very excited at the 
            prospect of real world experience in the sector. I consider myself a very motivated and determined individual. I pride myself on being a hard worker and feel 
            I work equally as well in a team or alone. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My main long term goals for the futue are to specialise in a particular skill set and master it but I also want to continually expand my knowledge and gain
            a well rounded and strong understanding of many fields wthin the industry. For the last two years in college we have been learning java and we have studied C++ this semester, 
            my short term goal for the summer is to build up a foundation in Python and to learn about gitHub and why it can be so useful.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I consider myself an athletic person, however I do not partake in any official team sports I do love to play football with my friends from the college regularly and in my spare time I enjoy going to the gym.
            My hobbies also include reading and I cycle to college everyday.
        </p>
