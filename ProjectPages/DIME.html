     For this project we had a group of five, the objective here was to develop an app idea and instead of actually making the app we had to market it through the construction of a website and by making a poster. The app we decided on was a sort of communication hub between students of the Clubs/Socs of their college where they get alerts about events and can sign up to Clubs/Socs in the app instead of being bombarded with emails. I done a lot of the core work for this project in consultation with the others in the group. I designed and built the site and the others worked on the content of the pages. The use colours and imagery to support the theme of the app impressed when we presented it to the module co-ordinator and we gained a lot of marks from it but overall the poster let us down as it wasnâ€™t eye catching enough and failed to convey clear and concise overall message.
